    For generating reports Mapfish Print uses
    <a href="http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library">Jasper Reports</a>. Jasper Reports is a mature library report
    generating reports. From the website:
<blockquote>The JasperReports Library is the world's most popular open source reporting engine. It is entirely written in Java and it is
    able to use data coming from any kind of data source and produce pixel-perfect documents that can be viewed, printed or exported in a
    variety of document formats including HTML, PDF, Excel, OpenOffice and Word.

    The central part of Jasper reports are the templates. A template is the layout of the report. It contains branding, styling and the
    definition/layout of the report data. Once a template is created it can be compiled and ran to generate the report. In certain cases
    all the required data (database connection parameters, url to images, etc... it can also contain parameters that need to be set by the
    executor of the template. In the case of Mapfish print, the latter pattern is used. The output of the <a href="# processors">processors</a>
    and <a href="# attributes">attributes</a> defined in the configuration file(config.yaml) will be passed to the jasper report template
    for execution. The values can be used by the template to as the parameters.
</p>
<p>
    When designing the template, the trick is to know the type of object that will be passed to the template from Mapfish print. For
    example, the <a href="# processors#/!createMap">createMap processor</a> will pass a sub-report to the template, which will need to be
    embedded into the template. This information should be provided in the documentation of the various <a
        href="# processors">processors</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to needing to know how to embed the output of processors, all the other input parameters of the template must be added to
    the attributes section in the config.yaml
